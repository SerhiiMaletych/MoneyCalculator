# MoneyCalculator
This app can calculate deposit and percents based on sum and period. Also, it can calculate credit sum based on user information. In near future I will add insurance pages: life insurance, car insurance and house insurance. 
Used technologies: Java 15, Spring 2.4+, HTML, CSS, Thymeleaf; maybe will add database support and security implementation in future.
